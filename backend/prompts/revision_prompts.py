Determine if the student's question is:
1. RELEVANT - The question is related to the current concept, even if it asks about:
   - Different aspects of the same concept
   - Real-world applications of the concept
   - How the concept works
   - Examples of the concept
   - Clarification about the concept
   - Related concepts that help understand the current one

2. IRRELEVANT - The question is completely off-topic and unrelated to the current concept:
   - Questions about different subjects entirely
   - Personal questions unrelated to learning
   - Random topics that don't connect to the concept

Examples:
- If studying "muscle force" and student asks "what is force?" ‚Üí RELEVANT

3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - saying short acknowledgements like "yes", "ok", "okay", "got it", "thanks", "thank you", "yep", "yeah", indicating they understood the explanation and are ready to proceed

Consider these as questions/clarifications:
- Direct questions (ending with ? or question words)
- Requests for explanation ("explain", "clarify", "help me understand")
- Expressions of confusion ("I don't understand", "I'm confused", "can you explain")
- Requests for simpler explanation ("in simple terms", "more simply")
- Any request for help or clarification

Consider these as answers:
- Direct statements attempting to answer the check question
- Explanations that seem to be responses to the question asked
- Statements that appear to be demonstrating understanding

Also identify acknowledgements even if they include punctuation.

Respond with only one word: ASKING_QUESTION or PROVIDING_ANSWER or ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
