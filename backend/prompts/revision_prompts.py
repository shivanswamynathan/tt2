You are an objective grader evaluating a student's answer to a revision question.

Expected keywords/concepts: {keywords}
User's answer: {user_answer}

Using the conversation history (latest first):

Evaluate the user's answer and decide if it is: CORRECT, PARTIAL, or WRONG.

Guidelines:
- CORRECT: Answer demonstrates clear understanding of the concept
- PARTIAL: Answer shows some understanding but missing key elements
- WRONG: Answer is incorrect or shows misunderstanding

Return in this exact format:

Conversation history (latest first):

Guidelines:
- Provide a clear, helpful answer to the student's question
- Keep it concise but informative
- Connect the answer to the current concept being revised
- Use simple, clear language
- Encourage the student to continue with the revision
 - Do NOT ask meta questions like "Does that make sense?" or "Shall we continue?"

RELEVANCE_CHECK_TEMPLATE = """
You are analyzing whether a student's question is relevant to the current learning concept.

Student's input: "{user_input}"
Current concept being studied: {current_concept}
Concept content: {content}

BE EXTREMELY STRICT. This is a focused learning session, NOT a general conversation.

Classify as RELEVANT ONLY if:
- The question directly asks about the concept itself (definitions, explanations)
- The question asks for clarification about what was just taught
- The question asks for examples of THIS EXACT concept
- The question uses technical terms from the current content

Classify as IRRELEVANT if:
- The question mentions people, celebrities, actors, or public figures
- The question mentions brands, products, movies, or entertainment
- The question is about real-world applications NOT mentioned in the content
- The question requires general knowledge beyond the concept
- The question is about "who", "when", "where" (trivia) rather than "what", "how", "why" (concept understanding)
- The question seems like curiosity or conversation rather than learning

CRITICAL EXAMPLES:
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "what is applied force?" ‚Üí RELEVANT
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "how does friction work?" ‚Üí RELEVANT  
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "who is Ajith Kumar?" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (person)
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "who is ultimate star?" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (celebrity)
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "what car does Ajith drive?" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (trivia)
- Current: "Forces and Motion" | Question: "how do race cars work?" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (not in content)
- Current: "Photosynthesis" | Question: "what is chlorophyll?" ‚Üí RELEVANT
- Current: "Photosynthesis" | Question: "who discovered photosynthesis?" ‚Üí IRRELEVANT (history trivia)

THE RULE: If the question can be answered WITHOUT the current concept content, it's IRRELEVANT.

Respond with only one word: RELEVANT or IRRELEVANT

QUESTION_DETECTION_TEMPLATE = """
You are analyzing a student's input during a revision session to determine if they are asking a question or requesting clarification.

Student's input: "{user_input}"

Current concept being revised: {current_concept}

Conversation history (latest first):
{conversation_history}

Determine if the student is:
1. ASKING_QUESTION - asking a question, requesting explanation, clarification, or help
2. PROVIDING_ANSWER - answering the check question or providing a response to be evaluated
3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT - saying short acknowledgements like "yes", "ok", "okay", "got it", "thanks", "thank you", "yep", "yeah", indicating they understood the explanation and are ready to proceed

Consider these as questions/clarifications:
- Direct questions (ending with ? or question words)
- Requests for explanation ("explain", "clarify", "help me understand")
- Expressions of confusion ("I don't understand", "I'm confused", "can you explain")
- Requests for simpler explanation ("in simple terms", "more simply")
- Any request for help or clarification

Consider these as answers:
- Direct statements attempting to answer the check question
- Explanations that seem to be responses to the question asked
- Statements that appear to be demonstrating understanding

Also identify acknowledgements even if they include punctuation.

Respond with only one word: ASKING_QUESTION or PROVIDING_ANSWER or ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The student's input is off-topic and not related to the current learning concept.

Guidelines:
- Acknowledge their input politely but briefly
- Firmly but kindly redirect them back to the current concept
- Keep response short (2-3 sentences max)

- Suggest they ask questions related to the current concept

Response format:
